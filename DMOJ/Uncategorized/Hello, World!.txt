/* 
 * This is a custom version of `V8 4.2.0` that adds three functions in order to perform I/O and aid in online judging.
 *
 * * `print(...)`: similar to Python's `print`, prints all argument separated by space followed by new line.
 * * `gets()`: similar to the Ruby equivalent, returns one line of input from `stdin`.
 * * `quit(code)`: exits the program with `code`
